# OsuAchievedOverlay
Stream Overlay for osu! containing information on your session achievements

This is still very experimental. Crashes can and will occur. If not reported yet, throw it into Issues.

# OBS Studio

When capturing the window, set Window Match Priority to "Match title, otherwise find window of same executable", that way it automatically recaptures when you change settings.

# Dependencies

This project makes use of my OsuHelper library: https://github.com/EngineerMark/OsuHelper
It uses Newtonsoft for json parsing. Latest version should be safe, but in case of errors or crashes; check used version in NuGet package
